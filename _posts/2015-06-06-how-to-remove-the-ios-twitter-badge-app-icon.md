title: How to Remove the iOS Twitter Badge App Icon
---

I get a little obsessive about clearing iOS Badge App Icons and find them to be distracting, so I prefer to disable them.

How to disable a Badge App Icon for any iOS app:

**Settings** > **Notifications** > **[App Name]** > **Badge App Icon** > **Disable**

That's great but what about when your Twitter Badge App Icon setting is missing? Bring back the setting by turning off Badging in the Twitter app:

**Twitter** > **Me (Profile)** > **Settings (Gear Icon)** > **General** > **Badge App Icon** > **Turn Off**
