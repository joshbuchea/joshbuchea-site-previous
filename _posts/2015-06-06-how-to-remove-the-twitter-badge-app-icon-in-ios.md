title: How to Remove the Twitter Badge App Icon in iOS
---

I get a little obsessive about clearing Badge App Icons and find them to be distracting, so I prefer to disable them.

How to disable a Badge App Icon for any app in iOS:

```
Launch Settings > Notifications > [App Name] > Badge App Icon > Disable
```

That's great but what about when your Twitter Badge App Icon setting is missing? Bring back the setting by turning off Badging in the Twitter app:

```
Launch Twitter > Me (Profile) > Settings (Gear Icon) > General > Badge App Icon > Turn Off
```
