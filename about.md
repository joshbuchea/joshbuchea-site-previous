I'm Josh Buchea. I'm a web & mobile software developer based in Portland, Oregon.

I've developed hybrid mobile applications for iOS & Android since 2011, and I've been developing for the web for over 17 years. I'm passionate about clean code and delivering great user experiences.

I do most of my work on my 13&quot; MacBook Pro. Although I own various mobile devices for development and testing, my go to mobile device is my iPhone. I prefer to code in a text editor; my editor of choice is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). I push code to [GitHub](https://github.com/joshbuchea). And I live in the [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/).

I'm a big fan of podcasts. Some shows I enjoy are [This Week In Tech](http://twit.tv/twit), [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/), [Design Details](http://www.designdetails.fm/), [Nitch](http://nitch.cc/podcast/), [ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com/), [JavaScript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/), [Adventures in Angular](http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular), [Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com/), [The Big Web Show](http://www.muleradio.net/thebigwebshow/), [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead), and [The Joe Rogan Experience](http://joerogan.net/podcasts/).
