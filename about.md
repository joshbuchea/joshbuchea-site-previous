I'm Josh Buchea. I'm an independent developer living and working near Portland, Oregon. I make websites and mobile apps. I'm passionate about building websites and apps that look great across as many devices and screen sizes as possible.

I do most of my work on my 13&quot; MacBook Pro. Although I own various mobile devices for development and testing, my smartphone and tablet of choice are my iPhone and iPad Mini. I prefer to code in a text editor; my editor of choice is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). I push code to [GitHub](https://github.com/joshbuchea). I extensively use the [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/).

Coming from a web development background, [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) allows me to leverage my existing skillset to build native mobile apps. I've been very excited about mobile devices ever since Apple released the 1st generation iPhone. When the iOS App Store was announced, I couldn't wait to build my first iPhone app. [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/) gives me the ability to get my apps into the various app stores and enables me to build cross-platform mobile apps with one codebase!

I'm a huge podcast fan and advocate. I subscribe to more shows than I can keep up with, but some shows I enjoy are [This Week In Tech](http://twit.tv/twit), [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/), [Nitch](http://nitch.cc/podcast/), [ShopTalk](http://shoptalkshow.com/), [JavaScript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/), [Adventures in Angular](http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular), [Developing Perspective](http://developingperspective.com/), [The Big Web Show](http://www.muleradio.net/thebigwebshow/), [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead), and [The Joe Rogan Experience](http://joerogan.net/podcasts/).
